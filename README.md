# GO Teacher SAI

Playing 1v1 board games such as chess is fine online, but it brings another level of excitement and gravitas when playing with a physical board and physical pieces in-person!

...But what if you have no one to play with in real life?

Go teacher Sai is a program that plays the board game 'go' against a human player autonomously.
It only relies on the human as an opponent, and to move the pieces for the ai.


Utilises Opencv for computer vision, and the leading open source AI 'KataGo' as its engine.
